Friends. Romans. Countryfolk. CYBORGS! 

The fall of Rome never came to pass. 

Chariot races and gladiator fights abound, and the Coliseum has become the default building on the streets of the world. Blood sport is sole reason for living, to beat up your fellow Romans to a pulp with enhanced limbs and senses. 

Emperor Cybigula reigns supreme and his fights are watched by all. 

The audience are unable to leave until their deceased remains crumble to dust, all to witness you battle and destroy your enemies. Who could turn down a good fight, who could bear to look away? You’ll be glued to your seat ‘til death do you part 

and even beyond…
